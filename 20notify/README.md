 This is like the 20 minute timer thing again, where with 20 minutes of screentime you have to stare at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This code is to run a desktop notification system that reminded you every 20 minutes to look at something 20 feet away. I had practice with Python, using plyer for notifications, and also practice with using Pyinstall to turn the code into .exe or executable files. requirements.txt is dependecies I downloaded in the virtual environment.
